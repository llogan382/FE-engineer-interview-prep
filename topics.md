# From the review guide:


# Web security issues

Dom manipulation.
Do as little as possible.

Browser Events. Everything that cante be done in Node.

HTTP headers
XML is used to exchange between the user agent and the server.

CSS Layout Techniques
Prevent layout shift. Grid, Flexbox.

AssetLoading
Load immediately. Everything User needs should be done in less than .1 seconds.
If not, see if you can defer. If the user leaves, there will be no analytics.


Async Requests
Pre-load if possible. Keep in mind variety of user devices- and bandwidths. In USA, mostly not a problem.
Talk about the stack- the JS stack is FIFO- starting with JS, then all browser/items will go into the queue until it is empty.

Memory Resource Management
Memoize whatever is possible.
Re-render as little as possible.
JS does good garbage collect- but dont create a ton of variables if they arent needed- like copying arrays, rather than modifying array in place.
Reduce loops- keep big O as small as possible.


Algorithms
Not gonna lie, dont use these. But I want the challenge of writing more efficient, scalable code.

System Designs
Keep business logic away from rendering components.
And write tests.


Accessibility
It is the ethical thing to do- I like using react testing library, it forces

Analytics


RENDERING:
Using TRANSLATE will help reduce layout shift.

# What is left?

Studying has taught me that I need to learn

`array.reduce()`
accumulators in recursive functions.

And the new method, `new Map()`

And that I should have learned with Leetcode sooner.


## Function Arguments

A **parameter** is in the function definition.
An **argument** is what gets passed in on the function call.


Phone screen interview:

FE Engineer inspector team.


Timeline:
5 minutes: Me


behavior
Tiem trying to understand complex problem?

Any specific problem? Performance. Code performance. Writing tests.

A time to make a hard decision for short term gain for long term value?
CSS libraries. 

Think thats all we have. 


9:18: Change to code. 


1/2 way: Coding portion

Him: Live code is not great. 
No auto-complete. Gives basic syntax highlighting. 
Mistakes: 

Use whatever syntax I want. Or react. Start at component level. 
Working implementation. To build it out, w pagination, order by SET. 
Paginate by groups of 5, show 3 at a time. 

Do not use bootstrap. 

9:23

Full widget: container w 5 blocks. Left arrow and right arrow will change pages. 

Last: final q's


What is the role like>?

They have a frontend team. 
My aspect: Operational. We build, focus is on running the apps. 

Ops is a big part of the job. 
And figuring out what customers want. 

FE engineer on the security platform. 

This role is a sister org- AWS security hub. It is the aggregator of all security hubs- reports, findings. 

Detective: does the same for S3 buckets. 

Know how to guide other engineers. Start a team. 

They have plans for a lot of things customers are asking for. 

I dont know how urgent this role is. 

I cant say how you did on the interview. 

Next steps: 2-5 
Between 2 and 5 business.
