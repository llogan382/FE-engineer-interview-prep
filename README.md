# FE-engineer-interview-prep
A repo of all the resources used for preparing for a front end engineer interview.
The items listed are not exhaustive- but simply reflect the front end concepts that I need to review.

As I find more websites and resources, I plan on listing them here.

# Job Description

The role is for a "FRONT END ENGINEER, AWS Security hub". The job posting includes:

- 3+ years of experience in modern web development with HTML5, CSS3.0, and JavaScript frameworks (React, Redux, Angular, Backbone.js, Knockout.js, etc.)
- 3+ years of experience with modern JavaScript tooling (Webpack, Gulp, Grunt, etc.)
- 3+ years of experience in at least one modern dynamic programming language (Ruby, Python, TypeScript, JavaScript)

PREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS:

- Experience translating design mockups and prototypes into working applications
- Experience building for large-scale and/or mission critical systems.
- DevOps experience operating the systems you built, including defining, building, and operating the required monitoring systems

## Resources

Look at leet [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) and get familiar with methods to break down a problem into its important parts.

the [front end interview handbook repo](https://github.com/yangshun/front-end-interview-handbook) has some great advice.

## Algorithms

- Binary Trees

## DATA structures

## HTML

Know the various meta tags.
## CSS

## Javascript

Q: What are the programming paradigms used in JS?

A: JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language, supporting imperative/procedural programming along with OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) and functional programming. JavaScript supports OOP with prototypal inheritance.

Q: What is Functional programming?

Q: What is the difference between classical inheritance and prototypal inheritance?

## APIs

Rest. What is it, and what are the advantages?


## Example problems.

- Write a code to determine if there are three integers in a given array of integers whose sum equals a given value.
- Write a program function to clone a given directed graph such that the cloned graph has the same edges and vertices.
- Write a code to merge two given sorted linked lists such that the returning linked list is also sorted.
- Given the roots of two binary trees, write a code to determine if the two binary trees are identical or not.
- Given the root node of a binary tree “B,” write a code to swap the right and left children for each node of the tree.
- Write a code to reverse the order of words in a given sentence.
- Given an array of size N, write a code to search for the second largest element in the array.
- Given an array A of size N, write a function to find the minimum index-based distance between two elements in the array.

## and concepts to know

JS:
- Closure.
- Promises
- Callbacks
- `this`
- higher order functions
- `spread` and `rest`. Spread is how to make a copy of arrays or objects. Rest is putting an arbitrary number of arguments to a function.
- Function declaration
- Function expression
- `hoisting`
- `use-strict`
- anonymous functions.
- scope


## Other tips:

- Begin your prep at least 10 weeks in advance because the subject matter to be covered is vast.
- Practice whiteboard coding for the onsite interview since recruiters can ask you to write code on a whiteboard. If you aren’t familiar with coding on a whiteboard, you may find it difficult to solve problems and articulate your thoughts simultaneously.
- Amazon assigns significant weightage to performance at behavioral interviews. The Bar Raiser round is designed to evaluate if you’re the right cultural fit at Amazon. Prepare well for the behavioral interviews.
- Answer questions on your past projects in the Situation, Task, Action, Result (STAR) format. This gives recruiters proper context about tasks you undertook to achieve project objectives.
Create a portfolio of your past projects and list details in the STAR format to gain a competitive edge.
- While practicing problems, identify patterns and learn how to apply them to new problems. This is a proven way to improve your problem-solving skills.
- Become well-versed with machine learning concepts and core concepts of a programming language of your choice.

## TODOS:


 - [] finish OOP course.
 - [] review Amazon STAR principles
 - [] practice leetcode
 - symbols
 - sets, maps
 - weaksets, weakmaps
 - property getters and setters
 - generators
 - proxy and reflect
 - Cookies
 - event bubbling
 - recursion
